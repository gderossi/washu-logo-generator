More Info:
This is a website allowing users to create custom WashU logos of the form "Washington University in ...". The site is entirely front-end and works by scaling the input text and logo SVGs. It's by no means an elegant solution, so I welcome anyone who is interested to make their own version with changes or improvements. All logos were originally obtained from the WashU website.
